  <!-- This is meant to be an extension point that hooks into ComputeFilesToPublish of any tool
  so that it can be called from outside the project and get a list of the files that will get
  bundled when PublishSingleFile=true. This is used to generate single-file tools signed in a single pass.

  This uses the private ItemGroup _FilesToBundle that gets populated in the target chain:
      ComputeFilesToPublish -> GenerateSingleFileBundle -> _ComputeFilesToBundle.
  There was no extensibility point to get this, but the single file team confirmed this
  would be the cleanest way currently and that it allows to easily consume the extension point when added.

  The exclusion is to make sure we don't sign the apphost before bundling the final tool.
  In pre 5.0-rc1 SDK's we have that the single-file host is named after the app. Afterwards
  we have it's just called apphost with some metadata. Discard both posibilities. -->
