 * This file defines the support classes that allow us to operate on the object graph of the process that SOS
 * is analyzing.
 *
 * The GCRoot algorithm is based on three simple principles:
 *      1.  Only consider an object once.  When we inspect an object, read its references and don't ever touch
 *          it again.  This ensures that our upper bound on the amount of time we spend walking the object
 *          graph very quickly reaches resolution.  The objects we've already inspected (and thus won't inspect
 *          again) is tracked by the mConsidered variable.
 *      2.  Be extremely careful about reads from the target process.  We use a linear cache for reading from
 *          object data.  We also cache everything about the method tables we read out of, as well as caching
 *          the GCDesc which is required to walk the object's references.
 *      3.  Use O(1) data structures for anything perf-critical.  Almost all of the data structures we use to
 *          keep track of data have very fast lookups.  For example, to keep track of the objects we've considered
 *          we use a unordered_set.  Similarly to keep track of MethodTable data we use a unordered_map to track the
 *          mt -> mtinfo mapping.
