    /// The pipeline is logically in one of these states:
    /// Unstarted - After the object is constructed and prior to calling RunAsync or
    /// StopAsync. No data is flowing.
    /// Running - The pipeline is doing whatever asynchronous work is necessary to flow
    /// data. Unstarted transitions to Running with a call to RunAsync()
    /// Stopping - The pipeline is doing a graceful shutdown to stop receiving any new
    /// data and drain any in-flight data to the sink. Unstarted or Running transitions to
    /// Stopping with a call to StopAsync(). Pipelines may also automatically enter a Stopping
    /// state when there is no data left to receive from the source.
    /// Stopped - All asynchronous work has ceased and the pipeline can not be restarted. This
    /// transition happens asynchronously from the stopping state when there is no
    /// work left to be done. The only way to be certain you have reached this state is to
    /// observe that the Task returned by StopAsync() or RunAsync() is completed or cancelled,
    /// usually by awaiting it.
