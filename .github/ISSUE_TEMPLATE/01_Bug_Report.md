### Description

<!--
* Please share a clear and concise description of the problem.
* Include minimal steps to reproduce the problem if possible. E.g.: the smallest possible code snippet; or a small repo to clone, with steps to run it.
* What behavior are you seeing, and what behavior would you expect?
  -->

### Configuration

<!--
* Is this related to a specific tool?
* What OS and version, and what distro if applicable?
* What is the architecture (x64, x86, ARM, ARM64)?
* Do you know whether it is specific to that configuration?
* Are you running in any particular type of environment? (e.g. Containers, a cloud scenario, app you are trying to target is a different user)
* Is it a self-contained published application?
* What's the output of `dotnet info`
  -->

### Regression?

<!--
* Did this work in a previous build or release - either of the tool or of the .NET runtime being used?
  -->

### Other information

<!--
* Please include any relevant stack traces or error messages. If possible please include text as text rather than images (so it shows up in searches).
* If you have an idea where the problem might lie, let us know that here. Please include any pointers to code, relevant changes, or related issues you know of.
* Do you know of any workarounds?
