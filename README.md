.NET Core Diagnostics Repo
==========================

This repository contains the source code for various .NET Core runtime diagnostic tools. It currently contains the managed portion of SOS and the lldb SOS plugin. One of goals of this repo is to build the lldb SOS plugin for the portable Linux platform (Centos 7) and the platforms not supported by the portable build (Centos 6, Alpine, eventually macOS) and to test across various indexes in a very large matrix: OSs/distros (Centos 6/7, Ubuntu, Alpine, Fedora, Debian, RHEL 7.2), architectures (x64, x86, arm, arm64), lldb versions (3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) and even .NET Core versions (1.1, 2.0.x, 2.1). 

Another goal to make it easier to obtain a version of lldb (currently 3.9) with scripts and documentation for platforms/distros like Centos, Alpine, Fedora, etc. that by default provide really old versions. 

This repo will also allow out of band development of new SOS and lldb plugin features like symbol server support for the .NET Core runtime and solve the source build problem having SOS.NETCore (managed portion of SOS) in the coreclr repo.
