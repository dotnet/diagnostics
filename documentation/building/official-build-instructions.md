To kick off an official build, go to this build definition: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build?definitionId=9462 and queue build leaving all the build variables as their defaults.

This signs and publishes dotnet-dump, dotnet-sos, dotnet-trace, dotnet-counters and Microsoft.Diagnostic.TestHepers packages to https://dotnetfeed.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet-core feed.
