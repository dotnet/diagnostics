Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

* If SOS or dotnet-dump analyze commands display "UNKNOWN" for types or functions names, your core dump may not have all the managed state. Dumps created with gdb or gcore have this problem. Linux system generated core dumps need the `coredump_filter` for the process to be set to at least 0x3f. See [core](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html) for more information.

* If dump collection (`dotnet dump collect` or `createdump`) doesn't work in a docker container, try adding the SYS\_TRACE capablity with --cap-add=SYS\_PTRACE or --privileged.
 
* If dump analysis (`dotnet dump analyze`) on Microsoft .NET Core SDK Linux docker images fails with an`Unhandled exception: System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'libdl.so' or one of its dependencies` exception. Try installing the "libc6-dev" package.
